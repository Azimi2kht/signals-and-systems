# üéµ Signals and Systems Course Project  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on **signal processing techniques** applied to **musical notes analysis** and **classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. It consists of two main sections:  

1. **Musical Note Analysis and Sound File Generation**  
2. **KNN-Based Classification of Musical Notes**  

The objective of the project is to analyze **musical notes**, extract their **dominant frequencies**, and classify them using **machine learning techniques**. Additionally, we construct an **audio file of "Happy Birthday" in Farsi** based on extracted note sequences.

## üéº Section 1: Musical Note Analysis  
This section involves **extracting fundamental frequencies** from **musical notes** and constructing a complete **Happy Birthday melody** using signal processing techniques.  

### **Key Steps:**  
1. **Extracting dominant frequencies** from individual note audio samples  
2. **Building a dataset** of musical notes from recorded sound files  
3. **Constructing the "Happy Birthday" melody** by sequencing the notes  
4. **Processing the recorded sound files** (stereo to mono conversion)  
5. **Validating the generated song** to ensure accuracy in pitch and duration

## ü§ñ Section 2: Musical Note Classification using KNN  
The second part of the project applies **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to classify musical notes based on their **extracted frequency components**.  

### **Key Steps:**  
1. **Creating labeled datasets**: 16 musical notes with known frequencies  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Computing dominant frequencies using **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**  
3. **Applying KNN classification** to categorize notes in the test dataset  
4. **Evaluating classification performance** with different values of **K**  
5. **Optimizing K**: Determining the best **K-value** for classification accuracy  

The best **K-value** was found to be **4**, balancing classification accuracy and computational efficiency.
